# PyWHMCS-DO
This script is intended to extend the functionality of the DigitalOcean module by ModulesGarden. Aimed for the pre-made image named 'Plesk on Ununtu 18.04' this program looks for a droplet with a tag which was given when it was provisioned and it configures Plesk according to the necesities.
